## Overview

Moonlight Coffee is designed to deliver the experience of visiting a local coffee shop in a digital format. The website contains all the elements you would expect in a restaurant website, including a menu, location information, and an about us section.

The site was built with Vue.js, using Vue Router to manage the routing for the SPA layout. The website also features smooth transitions between routes, implemented with the help of Anime.js.

The layout and styles were created using TailwindCSS, a utility-first CSS framework that provides a great deal of flexibility and control over the design.

The website is hosted and deployed using Firebase, allowing for a fast and reliable user experience.
