        <p class="text-xl mb-8">
      In 2023, Isaac and Peter, two nocturnal beings with an affinity for
      high-quality coffee, envisioned a place where the tranquil beauty of the
      night could be enjoyed alongside a warm cup of expertly crafted coffee.
      From this vision, Moonlight Coffee was born.
    </p>

    <p class="text-xl mb-8">
      Nestled in the heart of Orlando, our cafe has become a haven for night
      owls and coffee aficionados alike. The dark, cozy ambience paired with the
      delightful scent of freshly ground coffee provides the perfect setting to
      relax, work, or just contemplate the mysteries of the universe.
    </p>

    <p class="text-xl mb-8">
      We source our beans from small, sustainable coffee farms, ensuring that
      each cup of Moonlight Coffee serves not only our customers but also our
      global community. Our baristas are skilled artisans, weaving together the
      science and art of brewing that perfect cup of coffee.

        <p class="text-lg max-w-lg font-poppins">
          Isaac is a night owl by nature, with a fascination for the cosmos that
          traces back to his childhood. His love for astronomy led to countless
          nights of stargazing, where he found tranquility and peace. The idea
          of Moonlight Coffee was born on one such night, under a sky full of
          stars, where he wished to blend his love for the night and his passion
          for coffee into a unique experience.

          Peter, a coffee enthusiast and expert barista, has always felt a
          special connection to the moon and the serene silence it brings. His
          fascination with the art and science of coffee-making led her to
          explore a wide array of brewing methods and coffee beans from around
          the world. Teaming up with Isaac, she has been instrumental in
          curating the rich, flavorful coffee that defines Moonlight Coffee.
